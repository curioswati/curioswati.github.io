message: "<p>Hi Swati,
There is no discrimination done by Gods. All Varnas are given equal importance, you need to research more before coming to  conclusion that is there is discrimination in our ancient texts. Please first read Gita (translated by swami Chinamayanada)which have only 700 verses that summarized most of ancient texts. Indian originated  religion don&#39;t  follow same rule as abhramic religion. In Indian religion there is no concept of heaven or hell. You can do any Karma you want, it just that whether the result of your karma creates more misery to your life or not. We have beautiful concept of karma yog, bhakti yog, gyaan yog, raj yog you can follow as per your swadharma(your desires/vasnas, and desires should be exhausted) . You need to learn many moremore things before commenting that Varna system is discriminatory in nature, if according to someone&#39;s swadharma he is good at paainting he belongs to shudra varna, if someone&#39;s want to gain knowledge (both spiritual as well science) he belongs to bhramins. I have so may things to tell.....but I guess its of no use, your environment or friend circle may not believe in the true ancient text that is why you are spitting colonial thoughts!
 Don&#39;t be slave now, at least in your thoughts!</p>"
