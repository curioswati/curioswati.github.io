message: "<p>Hi Ashwini,
Thank you for participating here, really appreciate you putting down such detailed thought. Also thanks for putting the excerpts from the Bhagvada Gita here for fellow readers.</p>
<p>First things first. I understand you might have gotten offended by the post hence you happened to use such strong language. While I acknowledge your emotions, this blog is not a place for you to cross lines. Strong language is not tolerated hence I have gone ahead and removed those parts from the comment. If you think, any part of the post is strong language, please let me know and I&#39;ll see to moderate it.</p>
<p>Moving ahead, I am guessing either you didn&#39;t read the full post or you have misunderstood parts of it. I&#39;ll anyway explain it. The post is not about the Varna system itself. I had only sarcastically used the statement (has God created the Varna system?) If you carefully read that para, you&#39;ll understand.
The post is about how our texts have spread discriminatory ideas and there, I have already put references to the text (NatyaShastra) in question.
I haven&#39;t read Swami Chinmayananda&#39;s Gita, thanks for the recommendation, I&#39;ll give it a read sometime. I although have read the Bhagvada Gita (atleast 4 times), the Shiva Purana, the RamcharitManas. The Bhagvada Gita, I would say is not in the league of texts I have referred to in the post. But the other two does have similar mentions.</p>
<p>&quot;Dhor gawar Shudra Pashu Nari,
Yah sab tadan ke adhikari&quot;</p>
<p>You might be familiar with this verse from the &quot;RamcharitManas&quot;. Do I have to explain the meaning?
The Shiva Purana also has similar mentions.</p>
<p>I honestly didn&#39;t understand the connection of Abrahmic religion and colonial thoughts (now removed from comment). Till date, I have only been interested in Hindu Mythology and culture, so didn&#39;t come across much ideas from Abhrahmic religions. If you have good references for exploring them, please do share.</p>
<p>Thanks again for reading and expressing, but just be careful with the language.
Take care!</p>"
