message: "Hi Manish,
If I understood correctly, you might want to look at the gist here: [https://gist.github.com/curioswati/c9c2e91f472c702a7058c99f6dfbf2b4](https://gist.github.com/curioswati/c9c2e91f472c702a7058c99f6dfbf2b4).
Its purpose is to install jekyll with all required dependencies and that too through a python script. You can simply replace the apt command with yum commands to install Java. Hope this is what you were looking for."
